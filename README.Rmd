# arutil

This package has some useful functions that were useful while developing writing
R packages for Audio Elektronik. Those functions were stored on util.R of
each package but then there was a lot of copy pasting going when a function 
was necessary in multiple packages. This package was created to eliminate that
duplication. Include it in your packages `Imports` in `DESCRTIPTION` file. 
Install it like this: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("AudioElektronik/arutil")
````
