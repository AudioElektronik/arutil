arutil
======

This package has some useful functions that were useful while developing writing R packages for Audio Elektronik. Those functions were stored on util.R of each package but then there was a lot of copy pasting going when a function was necessary in multiple packages. This package was created to eliminate that duplication. Include it in your packages `Imports` in `DESCRTIPTION` file. Install it like this:

``` r
devtools::install_github("AudioElektronik/arutil")
```
